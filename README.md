# Bitcoin-MultiAddress-Checker
 Check unlimited BTC address 

## Warning!!! Do not immediately use the python script

## Requirements:
#### 1) Virtual Machine
#### 2) Any Linux Distribution
#### 2) BTC Addresses dump database
#### 3) Your list of addresses to crosscheck with the database. I named it mylist.txt
#### 4) Modify the wget address, Step 2. 
#### 5) Patience :D

## Here are the steps to check unlimited amount of address

#### 1) Create a shared folder on your VirtualBox. Ensure that your list of addresses is inside the folder.
#### 2) Type sudo apt-get fromdos.
#### 2) Power up your virtual machine with Linux
#### 3) Navigate to your shared folder. cd /media/yoursharedfolder 
#### 4)Open the terminal. Type wget http://addresses.loyce.club/blockchair_bitcoin_addresses_and_balance_September_08_2022.tsv.gz -0 - | gunzip > latestbtcaddress.txt
#### 5) type join <(sort latestbtcaddress.txt) <(sort mylist.txt | fromdos) > output.txt
#### 6) cat output.txt to check if your own list has balances inside. 

## So what is the BTCAddressBulkChecker.py for????
#### Well, if you want to verify your output.txt to another blockchain explorer like blockchain.com, follow these steps.
#### 1) Open your Microsoft Excel. 
#### 2) Click the Data tab and import the output.txt. 
#### 3) Save as output.csv.

## Misc
#### 1) The BTC addresses dump can also be found from this website https://blockchair.com/dumps. 
#### 2) Click Bitcoin/Addresses and install the tsv file. We cannot use windows to open this tsv file as it contains millions of BTC addresses. I personally used Kali Linux to do this ;).
#### 3) Remember that when creating a notepad in Windows it is considered a DOS file so when importing it in Linux.

## Credits
### I humbly appreciate Loyce for hosting a server to store the database dump.
